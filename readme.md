# Strands Clone
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

NYT Strands puzzles, to play alone or share with friends!

**Link to project:** 

## How It's Made:

**Front**: HTML, CSS, Javascript.

**Backend**: Python

### Puzzle creation:
Steps:
1. Get words either by manual user input, or ai-generated (gemini api key required)
2. Placed into grid layouts, until a valid puzzle layout is found.



## Optimizations

Layouts are lazily computed and stored in database.


You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
